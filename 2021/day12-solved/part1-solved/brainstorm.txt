convert input to map[string](map[string]bool)
compile a final map of all possible paths
keep a slice of partial paths starting with [][]string{{"start"}}
for len(partials) > 0
    pop the first path in progress
    for each cave connected
        if cave == "end"
            add path to final paths
            continue
        if cave is small and already in path
            continue
        add cave to path
        add path to partials
return length of final paths
