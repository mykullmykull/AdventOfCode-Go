start with fishes := []int{...}
count days to 256
each day, loop through each fish
    if fish == 0
        add 8 to fishes
        set fish to 6
        continue
    subtract 1 from fish

looping is too slow
instead, use a map to count the number of fishes at each age
start with fishes := [9]int{...} where each index is the age
count days to 256
each day, loop through each age
    create a new map with
        age 0 = fishes[age 1]
        age 1 = fishes[age 2]
        age 2 = fishes[age 3]
        age 3 = fishes[age 4]
        age 4 = fishes[age 5]
        age 5 = fishes[age 6]
        age 6 = fishes[age 7] + fishes[age 0]
        age 7 = fishes[age 8]
        age 8 = fishes[age 0]
    set fishes to the new map
