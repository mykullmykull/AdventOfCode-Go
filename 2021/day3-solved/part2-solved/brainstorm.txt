copy all lines to o2 and co2

loop through position
loop through each line
count zeros and ones
build string of most common bits    NOPE, we need to re-evaluate the most common bits every time we remove a line

remove from o2 any lines where each bit doesn't match most common bit
remove from co2 any lines where each bit doesn't match least common bit
convert from binary to decimal
return gamma * epsilon
