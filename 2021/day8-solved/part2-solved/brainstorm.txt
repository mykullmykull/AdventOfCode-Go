eliminateDigits
    number of wires != number of litSegs

eliminateSegs
    wire does NOT belong to a wireStr with a possible digit with that segment

eliminateMatchedSegs
    a small group of wires have the same small number of possible segments

hypotheticals
    loop through wires
        loop through possible segments
            assume that wire = segment
            loop through wStr
                if impossible, then remove that segment from wire's possible segments
                    wStr has that wire, but not that segment
                    wStr has that segment, but not that wire
                    
                    maybe others?
