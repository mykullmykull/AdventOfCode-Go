track a count of each possible pair pairCount
loop over 10 steps
    generate a newPairCount
    each pair AB with insertion C, 
        newPairCount[AC] += pairCount[AB]
        newPairCount[CB] += pairCount[AB]

count the occurrences of each letter
    each letter will show up twice, except for the first and last letters of the initial string which won't ever change
    add 1 more to the counts of the first and last letter
    divide all counts by 2
return most common - least common
