track a riskMap map[point]int
track a grid of calculated risks, marking each point with "x" if it has been calculated
update the riskMap in order spreading from the top left to the lowest adjacent points

initialize 
    risk total to value of top left point
    riskMap with top left point = risk total
    grid with top left point marked as "x"

each step
    find the min value on the grid adjacent to an "x"
    add min to the risk total
    for every grid point == min and is next to an "x"
        mark the point with "x"
        add the point to the riskMap with value = risk total

return riskMap[bottom left point]
