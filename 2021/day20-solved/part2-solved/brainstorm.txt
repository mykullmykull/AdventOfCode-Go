parse input
    enhancementAlgorithm := first line of input
    grid := all subsequent lines starting with the third line
loop twice
    add border of '.' around the grid
    add another border of '.' around the grid
    build new grid of the same size by...
    loop row 1 to len(grid)-2
        loop col 1 to len(grid[row])-2
            currentCell := grid[row][col]
            Grab 9 characters in a 3x3 square centered on the currentCell
            convert those 9 characters to binary (. = 0, # = 1)
            convert binary to decimal index
            get char at decimal index in the enhancement algorithm
            add char to new grid at row, col
