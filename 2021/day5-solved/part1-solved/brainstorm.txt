get max x and y from the input
    loop through input
    split to start and end
    split startX, startY, endX, and endY
    loop through []int{startX, startY, endX, endY}
    track maxX and maxY
    return maxX and maxY
build a seaFloorMap := [maxY][maxX]int
loop through each line and update the seaFloorMap
count the number of points >= 2
