get min and max of all the values
the cheapest spot has to be between them
loop from min to max
    for each position, calculate the cost
    if cost < minCost
        set minCost to cost
        set minPos to pos
print minPs
return minCost

calculate cost
    cost += factorial(abs(pos - fish))

factorial
    pair := 1 + n
    extraForOdds := 0
    if n % 2 == 1
        extraForOdds := n / 2 + 1

    pair * (n / 2) + extraForOdds
