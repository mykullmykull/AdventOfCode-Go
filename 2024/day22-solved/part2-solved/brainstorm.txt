Generate the list of 2000 price changes for each monkey
Loop through all possible combinations of 4 price changes
    sum the bananas each monkey would pay given that combination
    if sum is greater than the greatest sum so far, update the greatest sum
Return the greatest sum

write and test these functions:
    getPrice(secret int) int
    getPrices(start int, count int) []int
    getPriceChanges(start int, count int) []int
    buyBananasFromMonkey(start int, count int, sequence [4]int) int
    buyBananas(starts []int, sequence [4]int) int
    getNextSequence(last [4]int) [4]int

Calculate monkeys once instead of for each seq.


instead of looping through all possible sequences,
    keep a map of considered sequences,
    loop through each set of changes,
        loop through 


instead of looping through all real sequences
    keep a map of sequences => bananas
    loop through each monkey's changes
        update the map with the new bananas
    loop through all sequences and get biggest
