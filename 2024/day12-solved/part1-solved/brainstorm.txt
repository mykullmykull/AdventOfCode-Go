uncounted regions are letters, counted regions are '.'s
loop through rows and cols until you find a new region
spread to other connected cells of the same letter, keeping track of area and perimeter
	area is just the count of connected cells
	perimeter is a running total of each adjacent (n, s, e, and w) cell that doesn't match the current letter

	spread to collect all points in the region
	area = len(points)
	calculate perimeter
	mark points as counted

continue until no uncounted regions are found
