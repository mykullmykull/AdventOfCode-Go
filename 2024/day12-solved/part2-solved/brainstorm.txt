uncounted cells are letters
cells to count are '#'s
counted cells are '.'s

loop through rows and cols until you find a new region
mark connected cells of the same letter as '#'
count '#'s for area

mark cells with symbols for the walls
    # = no walls
    - = tp wall
    ] = rt walls
    _ = bm wall
    [ = lt walls
    1 = tp and rt
    2 = tp and bm
    3 = tp and lt
    4 = tp, rt, and bm
    5 = tp, bm, and lt
    6 = tp, lt, and rt
    7 = tp, rt, bm, and lt
    8 = rt and bm
    9 = rt and lt
    0 = rt, bm, and lt
    ! = bm and lt 

loop through rows and cols counting 
    tp walls where the cell to the left doesn't have a tp wall
    rt walls where the cell above doesn't have a rt wall
    bm walls where the cell to the left doesn't have a bm wall
    lt walls where the cell above doesn't have a lt wall

mark all non-letters as '.'
