we know how many turns the shortest path has
bestTurns = best / 1000
bestSteps = best % 1000
fill in dead ends
make one grid copy for valid points
make one grid copy for unreachable points

check if each point in the grid can reach S and E in best turns
    if the point is '#', 'S', or 'E', then skip it
    if we can't reach both S and E with fewest turns then skip
        grow straight as far as possible
        then add 1 to turns
        if ever we hit S or E then lock in shortest number of turns
        if ever turns to S + turns to E > best turns then skip
        if point works with turns, then
            mark this point 'T' on valid points grid copy
            mark all reachable points with 'R' on unreachable points grid copy

mark all unreachable points with '#'
fill in dead ends

check if each point in the grid can reach S and E in best steps
    if we can't reach both S and E with fewest steps then skip
        grow one step at a time
        if ever we hit S or E then lock in shortest number of steps
        if ever steps to S + steps to E > best steps then skip
        if point works with turns, then mark this point 'X' on valid points grid copy

check if each point on valid points grid copy is a backtracker
    if the point isn't 'X' then skip it
    if the point is next to 'S' or 'E' then skip it
    if the point only touches one other 'X' then make it '.'

Count Xs on valid points grid copy
