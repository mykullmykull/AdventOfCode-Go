parse antenas into points with row and col
consider each pair of antenas
    if their frequencies are different continue
    calculate the two possible antinodes and count any within the grid
        calculate the slope of the LINE connecting the two antennas
        calculate the size of the GAP between the two antennas
        find the points along the LINE the same GAP from each antenna

STRUCTS
point {
    row int
    col int
}

pair {
    a point
    b point
}

FUNCTIONS
pair.rowGap() int
pair.colGap() int
pair.antinodes() []point
