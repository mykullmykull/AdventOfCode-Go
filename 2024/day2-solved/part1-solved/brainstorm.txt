parse the input into [][]int
loop through each row
    loop through each index
        if index == 0 then set slope (increasing or decreasing)
        if next level is going the wrong way, return false
        if next level is too far away (diff > 3), return false
    if we haven't returned yet, return true
    
    if row is safe true, then add 1 to total
