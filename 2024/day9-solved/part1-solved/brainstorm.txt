The real input is too long to expand into the string format suggested in the example

parse input into files (id, size) and spaces (size)
keep track of whether we're moving a file or not, diskPosition, and the checksum
start diskPosition at the first file's length (since the first file id is 0, it won't add to the checksum at all, so we can just skip it)
start out moving a file
loop until there are no files left
    if moving a file
        space = spaces[0]
        if space.size == 0
            remove spaces[0]
            moving = !moving
            continue

        file = last file
        if file.size == 0
            remove file
            continue
        
        checksum += diskPosition * file.id
        file.size--
        space.size--
        diskPosition++
        continue

    file = files[0]
    checksum += diskPosition * file.id
    file.size--
    diskPosition++
