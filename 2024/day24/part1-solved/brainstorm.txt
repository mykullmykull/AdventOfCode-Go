make a map of all wireValues
    map[string]int
    initially, every value will be -1
make a map of all gates 
    map[string]gate
make an array of all unknown wire values
    []string
loop through starting wires
    set wireValue
    delete wire from unknowns

loop through unknowns until none left
    evaluate gate
        if some input is -1, then return -1
        AND => both wires are 1 then return 1 else return 0
        OR => either wire is 1 then return 1 else return 0
        XOR => one wire is 1 and the other is 0 then return 1 else return 0
    if gate returns -1 then continue
    set wireValue
    remove wire from unknowns

calculate binary number from z wires
