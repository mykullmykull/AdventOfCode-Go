map basic path to point => steps
consider starting a cheat at every point
        skip if not '#'
        cheatStartStep = lowest adjacent step + 1
        consider ending the cheat at every point
                skip if not '.'
                cheatLength = abs(cheatStart.row - cheatEnd.row) + abs(cheatStart.col - cheatEnd.col)
                skip if cheat length > 20
                cheatSteps = cheatStartStep + cheatLength
                savings = normalStep - cheatSteps
                count if savings >= target


write and test:
x   update map, replace outer walls with *
x   function to find the shortest route between S and E
x   function to add a cheat to the map (erase walls)
x   function to loop through all possible cheats
        must start at a wall
        must end at a path
        must be less than 21 steps
x   function to count cheats that save at least 100ps

run with cheat
    mark cheat start as 1
    mark cheat end as 2
    t1 = from S to 1
    t2 = cheat length
    t3 = from 2 to E
    time = run1 + run2 + run3
