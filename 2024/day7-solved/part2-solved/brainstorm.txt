loop through each line 
    look for valid equations by 
        parse elements (target: elements)
        loop through elements, keeping a list of possible results
            loop through all possible results, and replace with new results
                result + current
                result * current
                if ever a new result > target then throw it away
            }
        }
        equation is valid if one of the possible results == target
    if valid, add test value to total
return total
