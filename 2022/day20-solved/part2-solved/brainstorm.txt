When moving an element, we need to
    wrap it if it goes out of bounds
    update the indexes of remaining elements to be moved


STRUCTS
    toMix:  []int
    coords: []int

    element struct {
        startingPosition int
        value int
    }

[x, x, x, -10, x]
    [x, x, x, x]
    [x, 10, x, x, x]

[x, 10, x]
    [x, x]
    [x, 10, x]

[x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, 9]

How to get the new index?
    places to move = abs(val) % len(array)
    direction to move = val / abs(val)
    new index = old index + places to move * direction

After getting the new index, update all toMix indexes
    get max/min of old & new
    loop through all toMix, updating those between min and max
    if direction > 0 decrease the index
    if direction < 0 increase the index
