Create two lists:
    one a list of coordinates to be mixed "coords"
    one an ordered list of their indexes "indexes"
For each index,
    find the coord
    calculate the new index
        places to move = abs(val) % len(array)
        direction to move = val / abs(val)
        new index = old index + places to move * direction
    rebuild list of coords
    update list of indexes
        get max/min of old & new
        loop through all toMix, updating those between min and max
        if direction > 0 decrease the index
        if direction < 0 increase the index
Loop until no indexes are left
rotate coords until 0 is at the front
a = 1000th coord
b = 2000th coord
c = 3000th coord
return a + b + c
