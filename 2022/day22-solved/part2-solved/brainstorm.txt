How will wrapping work?
    instead of jumping, we should progress one step at a time
    Track which side we're on (ft, bk, tp, bm, lt, or rt), and the translation function for moving from one to the other.

enums
    // grid directions
    up = 0
    dn = 1
    lt = 2
    rt = 3

    // cube sides
    tp = 4
    bm = 5
    ft = 6
    bk = 7
    ls = 8
    rs = 9

gridPoint struct {
    row int
    col int
    side int
    facingRow int
    facingCol int
}

moveToNextSide(from gridPoint, direction int) gridPoint

board struct {
    grid     []string
    walls    []gridPoint
    position gridPoint
    instructions string
}

parse([]string) board
board.popInstruction() (string, string)
gridPoint.turn(string) gridPoint
board.move(string) board
gridPoint.wrapSides() gridPoint
board.getFacingScore() int
