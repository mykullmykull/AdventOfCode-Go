should track
    facing (rowChange, colChange)
    position (row, col)
    instructions

pop first instruction off the front
    either R
    or L
    or a number (get string before the next R or L)

adjust facing based on instruction

move position based on instruction

repeat until no instructions left


How to move most efficiently
    track row widths
    track col heights
    track wall positions

    when moving, 
        if nearest wall (considering wrapping) is within the planned move
            move to wall
        if move exceeds width/height
            wrap
