Track each elf's position on a grid of strings
Each of 10 rounds:
    Expand grid by 1 in each direction that elf is touching the edge
    Swap each # with an arrow designating their proposed move, and mark each proposed destination with O
        If ever a proposed destination already has an O then change the O to an X
        loop
            if 'O'
                Replace the arrow pointing to it with .
                Replace it with #
            if 'X'
                Replace all arrows pointing to it with #
                Replace X with .
Shrink grid until an elf is touching each edge
Count empty spaces
