Design

	For each branch
		skip the entire branch if ever...
			not enough time to save for the next robot
			// branch builds 2 before 1 or 3 before 2
			//  tried this, and it made the test slower
		save for the next robot
		update time, materials, and robots

what do we need to track?
	branch
		Order of robots to build, up to a possible 24 robots (one per minute)

	state
		- branch
			Array of enums, index of next robot = total robots - 1
		- materials
			Array of ints, index = enum
		- robots
			Array of ints, index = enum
		- costs per robot type
			map of enum to array of ints
