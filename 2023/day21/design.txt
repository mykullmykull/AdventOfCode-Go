store a map of new locations based on base location


PART1
structs
    location:
        row: int
        col: int

        getNextLocations(grid []string) []location
        isValidLocation(grid []string) bool

debug functions
    printGrid(grid []string, locations []location)

flow
    1. Find starting location
    2. Loop thru steps
        - Loop thru locations
            - Get next locations
                - N, S, E, W
                - Check each for rocks
            - Add valid locations to map (to prevent duplicates)
        - Pull all keys from map and set as locations
    3. Return length of final locations
