The infinite farm is a sequence of subFarms represented by the input.
Because the subFarm's Column and Row containing the Start pixel are free of rocks, the entire walkable area 
    will be roughly a diamond shape. Most of it will consist of subFarms that are entirely walkable.

Each subFarm is identified by its distance to the right and down from the center subFarm.
    subFarm {
        rt int,
        dn int,
    }

General strategy will be to
    count the spaces in the center subFarm reachable by an even number of steps (evenSpotsCount) and 
        those reachable by an odd number of steps (oddSpotsCount),
    count the subFarms that are an even number of steps from the center subFarm (evenSubFarmsCount) and
        those that are an odd number of steps from the center subFarm (oddSubFarmsCount),
    multiply the evenSpotsCount by the evenSubFarmsCount and the oddSpotsCount by the oddSubFarmsCount,
    add the spaces reachable in each edge subFarm

Since the starting pixel lies in the center of the center subFarm we know a few things:
    subFarms to the left of center will be identical to those to the right of center,
    subFarms above center will be identical to those down from center,
    the shortest path to the farthest right subFarm will be in the center Row,
    the shortest path to the farthest down subFarm will be in the center Column,
