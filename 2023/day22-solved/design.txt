strategy
    1. Settle the bricks
    2. For each brick, count the number of bricks that will move if it is disintegrated
        -remove it from the list
        -loop through the remaining bricks list
            -if another brick would move, count it, remove it, and loop again
            -as soon as nothing else moves, return the count

    canDisintegrate(bricks []brick) bool

strategy
    1. Settle the bricks
        -loop through bricks until no more bricks can fall
            -for each, if it can fall, subtract 1 from its z.min and its z.max
    2. Loop through bricks
        -for each, if every brick it is supporting is being supported by another then count it as disintegratable
